# Bon Voyage

A mobile-first, randomized local adventure generator! 

This application allows users to select personal preferences, and then with those choices, provide a personalized roadmap to their night.
Each listing generated provides milage from the user and directions to the location.

If desired, the app can completely randomly generate the options, too! Think of this as geocaching for your city.

This app was built using React.js, Express.js, Node.js, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap. The Bing Maps Local Places API was used to generate local data.

A working demo, deployed with Vercel and Heroku, can be used here:
